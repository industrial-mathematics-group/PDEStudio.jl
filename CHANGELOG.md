# Changelog

What has changed since the last release. Released versions are described in the
[releases](https://github.com/blhackslash/PDEStudio.jl/releases) and the git history.

## Unreleased

### Changed
- **Quick start with the built-in examples of PDEStudioCore:** `set_sim_config!(test_advection_1d())` (or
  `test_burgers_1d`, `test_heat_1d`, `test_heat_2d`, `test_poisson_2d`, `test_particles_2d`) shows a ready example;
  README and docs start with them. `examples/advection_1d.jl` is removed: the example solvers are maintained in one
  place, PDEStudioCore's `src/Examples/` (needs a PDEStudioCore release that has them).
